# 04-bitmap-transformer

**FUNCTIONALITY**

**REVERSE**
Our first function to change the bitmap image simply takes the array of pixels from the argument provided, then will reverse them to make a 180 degree flipped version of the bitmap image

**COLOR SWAP**
Our second function to change the bitmap takes in the object as an input and finds the color values, and changes them to their "opposite" value and puts out an image of the bitmap where all the pixels are in the same order but the colors are inverted.

**SHUFFLE**
This last function to change the bitmap takes in the array of pixels as an argument, and uses a random number generator and iterates through each pixel and changes the positioning within the array to return a bitmap image of the pixels scattered all around and the end result should basically look like an old TV that couldn't find a signal.
